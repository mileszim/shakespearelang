[Enter Hamlet & Romeo]

Hamlet:
 You lying stupid fatherless big smelly half-witted coward!
 You are as stupid as the difference between a handsome rich brave
 hero and thyself! Speak your mind!

 You are as brave as the sum of a fat little stuffed misused dusty
 old rotten codpiece and a beautiful fair warm peaceful sunny summer's
 day. You are as healthy as the difference between the sum of the
 sweetest reddest rose and a pony and yourself! Speak your mind!

 You are as cowardly as the sum of yourself and the difference
 between a proud kingdom and a flower. You are as happy as the sum of
 yourself and the sum of a peaceful pony and a brave cunning hero. Speak your mind!

 Speak your mind!

[Exit Hamlet]

          Scene II: The praising of Juliet.

[Enter Juliet]

Romeo:
 Thou art as sweet as the sum of the sum of myself and a hero and a 
 cute cat. Speak your mind!
